=========================
Number Guess (in Clojure)
=========================

This is simply a Clojure rewrite of an old assignment for school I've written in C++ and Python previously. Just wanted to see if I could do it and brush up on my Clojure.

-----------
To Compile
-----------

1. Install `leiningen <https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen>`_
2. Clone this repo
3. cd to the install directory
4. Run `lein deps`
5. Run `lein uberjar`
6. Run `java -jar numguess-1.0.0-standalone.jar`

Dependencies

This package only requires Java, which you can download from `here <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_. The Clojure code will compile to JVM bytecode.
